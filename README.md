Develop product search microservices

## Introduction

We have the ambitious goal of rebuilding Amazon.com’s shopping experience as a set of microservices. To keep the scope narrow, please focus on the core features that relate to the “core user activity” of “purchasing an item”. The mandatory services to include in the design are the authentication service and the item search service.

### Required Deliverables

- [ ] A **prioritized high-level technical roadmap** for building these microservices.
- [ ] **Release planning** based on the roadmap.
- [ ] Set of **KPIs** to track the success of the product as we progress on our roadmap and how
      we can measure them.
- [ ] A **high-level diagram** of all the proposed microservices and their communications with
      each other. _Ideally, use UML_.
- [ ] **High-level technical specification documents** for all services. (Architecture, tooling,
      framework, ...)
- [ ] **API definition** for the microservices using _OpenAPI/Swagger_
- [ ] The **database schema/s** for the proposed microservices.
- [ ] Implement a simple version of the **authentication service** using PHP 7+ and a framework
      of your choice and **deploy it** to AWS, Google Cloud or Azure.
- [ ] **Share the URL** for us to test.
- [x] Please **use Git** as version control. Create a **new project** in your own GitHub
      account and push the code to it.
- [ ] Pay special attention to the **“README.md”** document, we would like you to keep
      it _as informative as possible_.
- [ ] Please also **push all the documentation and diagrams** to GitHub.

### Bonus Items

- [ ] Build a **“Login”** UI using a JS framework of your choice to use the Auth API.
- [ ] Demonstrate **CI/CD** chops
- [ ] Use **Docker and/or Kubernetes**
- [ ] Use **Terraform or CloudFormation**
